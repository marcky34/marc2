        Hello, I am Marc Nelson Gonzales, a IT Student at University of Pangasinan Dagpan Campus
        I'm a passionate and focused IT student that has a strong love for coding. 
        I'm motivated to learning and becoming an expert programmer. My passion to use code to create original solutions 
        and bring concepts to life has driven me to pursue a career in information technology. I'm passionate about 
        web development and have a never-ending desire to learn new things, therefore I work hard to improve my abilities 
        and keep up with current developments in technology. I'm excited to contribute to the always changing industry of
        software development because I think that coding is a powerful tool that can turn ideas into solutions that have 
        an impact, rather than just a talent.
